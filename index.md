## What is ACA?
**AI Coaching Assistant is a virtual sports performance coaching assistant that uses state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning tools.**

This is your invitation to take part in a series of experiments to help us create a new paradigm for coaching Olympic weightlifting athletes.

## Participating in the ACA project
We are recruiting participants for the following study:
    “MARKERLESS POSE DATA USE FOR NUMERIC METRIC EXTRACTION, APPLIED AS FEEDBACK IN OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING”

This study is part of a PhD project (by Gatis Jurkāns) stemming from the **Human Cybernetics Lab** at **Aston University** and supported by **Gymshark**. 

### Study Description
This study will have Olympic weightlifting athletes like yourself participating in video-recorded training sessions. Experiments will resemble standard training sessions and the participating athletes will only be asked to perform lifts and assistance movements that they are already highly proficient at.

Sessions will be performed in dedicated gyms with appropriate weightlifting platforms, with cameras capturing the performances. The video data collected of these lifts will be used to generate numerical performance metrics. The focus across all the recording sessions will be on the technique. **During some of the recording sessions a weightlifting coach will assess the quality of your technique.**

As a thank you participants will receive a personalised report about different aspects of their lifting performance.

**The current series of experiments are being run at the following locations:**
* Warley Weightlifting Club (Birmingham, United Kingdom)
* University of Birmingham: Sports and Fitness Centre (Birmingham, United Kingdom)

### Criteria for participation
* This study is open to participants aged between 18 to 40 years old:
    * For participants aged between 18 to 30 years of age you must have **at least 2 years** of experience in the sport of Olympic weightlifting.
    * Participants aged 31 to 40 years old must have **at least 5 years** of experience in the sport of Olympic weightlifting. 
    * Furthermore, you must not be currently recovering from any severe injuries or illnesses that could potentially hinder your weightlifting ability. We would respectfully request that for safety reasons if you are recovering from any injuries or illnesses, you do not proceed to participate in this study.

### How would you like to reach us?
If you would like to participate in the study email us at:
* [ai.coaching.assistant@gmail.com](mailto:ai.coaching.assistant@gmail.com) 
* [gjurk22@aston.ac.uk](mailto:gjurk22@aston.ac.uk) 

And we will get back to you with the next steps for participation.

Thank You for showing interest, we look forward to working with you!
## Origins of ACA

As a fellow weightlifter, I know how incredibly technical Olympic lifts are. When the world pandemic happened most of us realised that there was very little we could do to improve technique when training by ourselves. I wanted to create something that could better help me manage my training and give me data-driven insights into my progression.
